# árvore fracionária
- tamanho: size of the original branch, I recommend useing a value between 200 and 300.
- rácio: the racio between the size of the branches of the current iteration and the 
next one, you should use a value in the range 0.6 go 0.7.
- ângulo: angle between the branche of a division, the unit is degrees.
- n_ramos: the number of branches generated in a division, the will fill angle chosen, 
it was to be a integer bigger than 1
- iterações: the number of iterations, above 15 the difference stops to be noticable .

You can press the 'r' key to draw the window again, in case you have changed the window size.
